 * ParseException, URISyntaxException, etc. <br> This is in contrast to operations that can and will fail as a matter of course. Any operation that
 * performs IO or has a side-effect falls into this category. Examples of these tyupes of issue are: IOException, SocketException, SQLException, etc.

 * where IO or side-effects occur, use {@code IoException}. For other cases, default to using {@code UnexpectedException}.
